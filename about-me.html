                                <span class="bold-text">I had so many things</span>. that I thought that I loved, but
                                the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
                            </p>
                            <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and
                                I couldn't hold a relationship. </p>
                            <h2>How I turned things around</h2>
                            <p><span class="bold-text"> I literally</span> put 90% of my possessions in the garbage,
                                sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
                            <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know
                                what else to do. And it worked. </p>
                            <h2>Now I live the simple life</h2>
                            <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy
                                life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
                            <p>With how much it turned my life around, <span class="bold-text"> felt like I had no
                                    choice but to start sharing how I did it</span>, and how others can benefit from
                                living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
